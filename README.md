Water Demand Forecasting 

Forecasting water demand is critical for efficient resource management in urban and rural areas. This project implements various machine learning models to predict short-term and long-term water demand using Python and open-source libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Prophet, and XGBoost.

📌 Features

📈 Time-series water demand forecasting (daily/weekly/hourly)

🌦️ Integration with external variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, holidays)

🧠 ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Prophet

🛠️ Preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline

📊 Model evaluation with MAE, RMSE, MAPE

🧪 Easy to extend and retrain on custom datasets
